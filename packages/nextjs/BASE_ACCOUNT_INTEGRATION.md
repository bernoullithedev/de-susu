# Base Account Integration

This document describes the Base Account integration implemented in this scaffold-eth project.

## Overview

Base Account is a smart contract wallet solution that provides enhanced security and functionality for users on the Base network. This integration allows users to connect their Base Accounts through the wallet interface.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Dependencies

The following packages are required:
- `@base-org/account`: Base Account wallet connector
- `wagmi`: Web3 React hooks
- `@rainbow-me/rainbowkit`: Wallet connection UI

### 2. Configuration

#### Network Configuration
- Base mainnet (chain ID: 8453) has been added to the target networks
- RPC endpoint: `https://mainnet.base.org`

#### Wallet Connectors
The Base Account wallet connector has been added to the wagmi connectors configuration in `services/web3/wagmiConnectors.tsx`.

### 3. Components

#### Custom Connect Button
A custom `ConnectButton` component has been created in `components/landing/ace-navbar.tsx` that:
- Shows "Connect Base Account" when not connected
- Displays account information when connected
- Shows a "Base" badge for Base Account users
- Handles network switching

#### Base Account Hook
The `useBaseAccount` hook (`hooks/scaffold-eth/useBaseAccount.ts`) provides:
- Connection status
- Base Account deployment status
- Network detection
- Loading states

### 4. Features

#### Authentication
- Users can connect their Base Accounts through the wallet interface
- The system detects if a user has a Base Account deployed
- Network switching is supported

#### UI Enhancements
- Custom styling for Base Account connections
- Visual indicators for Base Account users
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### 5. Usage

#### Connecting a Base Account
1. Click the "Connect Base Account" button in the navbar
2. Select Base Account from the wallet options
3. Approve the connection in your wallet

#### Checking Base Account Status
```typescript
import { useBaseAccount } from "~~/hooks/scaffold-eth";

const { isConnected, hasBaseAccount, isOnBaseNetwork } = useBaseAccount();
```

### 6. Future Enhancements

- Real Base Account deployment checking
- Gasless transactions support
- Batch transaction support
- Social recovery features

## Files Modified

1. `services/web3/wagmiConnectors.tsx` - Added Base Account connector
2. `scaffold.config.ts` - Added Base network configuration
3. `hooks/scaffold-eth/useBaseAccount.ts` - Created Base Account hook
4. `hooks/scaffold-eth/index.ts` - Exported new hook
5. `components/landing/ace-navbar.tsx` - Updated with custom connect button

## Notes

- The Base Account integration is currently simplified and assumes users have Base Accounts if they connect via the Base Account wallet
- In a production environment, you would want to implement proper Base Account deployment checking
- The integration supports both local development (Foundry) and Base mainnet networks
